This folder contains codes corresponding to application of BC-PINN method to ship simulations

Reynolds number = 3.9e+9
Time step = 0.01
Temporal domain =(20,26)s 
Domain considered = (-5,-2) to (-10,2) and complete z [ wake region behind ship]
CFD simulations are done in STAR CCM+ commercial cfd solver
