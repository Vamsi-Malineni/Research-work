# Assignment 1: Neural Network model development
----------------------------------------------------
In this project we implement a feed forward neural network and use gradient descent (and its variants: momentum, NAG, RMSProp, ADAM, NADAM) with backpropagation for classifying images from the fashion-mnist data over 10 class labels. We use wandb for visualisation of data for training, model comparison and accuracy of a large number of experiments that we have performed to make meaningful inferences.
# Libraries Used:
1. We have used numpy for all the mathematical calculations in forward propagation, back propagation algorithm and loss (cross entropy and squared error) function computation.
2. Scikit learn library was used to generate the confusion matrix which was converted into a dataframe using pandas library. 
3. Seaborn and matplotlib libraries were used for plotting the confusion matrix.
4. Keras and tensorflow was used for getting the fashion mnist dataset.
5. Pickle was used to save the best neural network model obtained during training.
